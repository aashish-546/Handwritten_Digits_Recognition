MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. MNIST set is a large collection of handwritten digits. It is a very popular dataset in the field of image processing. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
Our goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.Classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of the 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9.
